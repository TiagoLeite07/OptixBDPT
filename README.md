OptixBDPT
=========

This project's goal is to develop a bidirectional path tracer using OptiX, and to compare it with a standard path tracer, also developed using OptiX.
Our goal is to compare both implementations' image quality and rendering time.

To run this project, a Nvidia graphics card is required, as well as having both CUDA and OptiX installed on your system.
Additional libraries are used such as DeviL to load and store images, freeglut to provide interactive interface, and Assimp to import the various test scenes.
